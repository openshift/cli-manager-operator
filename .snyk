          InsecureSkipVerify is intentionally used in e2e test code to verify
          OpenShift routes with self-signed certificates. This is a test-only
          scenario checking route availability, not production code. The test
          validates that the route is accessible, which requires bypassing TLS
          verification for routes using self-signed certificates in test clusters.
